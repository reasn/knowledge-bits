# Hiring & Being Hired

### Hiring someone

💡 "Culture Add" matters a lot more than "Culture Fit" - [Meri Williams](https://www.slideshare.net/meriwilliams/5-things-i-wish-id-known-sooner-about-scaling-teams-culture-at-turing-fest)

💡 People who want to bring their own framework/solution are trouble: Risk of self-focus and insecurities. - Alexander Thiel

🐾 Take strategic hires out for dinner and don't talk work at all. It's the most efficient way to find out whether you'll work as a team.  - Unknown executive recruiter.

💡 Best predictor for being able to recruit and retain the people you want is somebody's ability to agree with the statement "someone like me can be successful here"  - [Meri Williams](https://vimeo.com/99813968)
