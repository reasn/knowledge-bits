# Leadership

### General

💡 Management = "Create Space to be Awesome" = "Purpose + Autonomy + Mastery + Inclusion" - [Meri Williams](https://vimeo.com/99813968)

💡 There are three kinds of managers: the shit umbrella, the shit funnel and the shit fan. - [Caterina Fake](https://twitter.com/caterina/status/6715084157)

🐾 Tell people that I **believe** in them and **why** I believe in them - [Meri Williams](https://www.slideshare.net/meriwilliams/5-things-i-wish-id-known-sooner-about-scaling-teams-culture-at-turing-fest)

💡 The demand upon a resource tends to expand to match its supply if the price is zero. Example: Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion - [Various, including Cyril Northcote Parkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law)

💡 Only three things happen naturally in organizations: friction, confusion, and underperformance. Everything else requires leadership. - [Peter Drucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker)

### Communication

🐾 Repeat yourself at least 7 times: Others still need to hear beyond the point when you're worried you've been repetitive - [Meri Williams](https://www.slideshare.net/meriwilliams/5-things-i-wish-id-known-sooner-about-scaling-teams-culture-at-turing-fest)
