# Tiny Tool Hacks

:bulb: Master your Environment: We're working with ever-more sophisticated tools every day. Every step to save a few seconds or minutes allows you to focus on what's important to you and increases your efficiency.

🐾  Quick-access custom searches in your browser. You can easily save hotkeys to search Google Maps, LinkedIn, a dictionary, your Google Drive or virtually any other site [in Google Chrome](https://zapier.com/blog/add-search-engine-to-chrome/) and [in Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-or-remove-search-engine-firefox). Instead of a term, use a single letter to save time (e.g. m for Google Maps, l for LinkedIn, ...)

#### 👾 Toolbar bookmarks to create new documents in drive

* [https://docs.google.com/document/create](https://docs.google.com/document/create)
* [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/create](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/create)
* [https://docs.google.com/presentation/create](https://docs.google.com/presentation/create)

#### 👾 Pin tabs for email, calendar, task board and other important websites

* Hotkey access via CMD+1 (depends on operating system)

#### 👾 Get rid of print-only margins in Google Docs

* Google Docs enables the print layout by default. Assuming you rarely print, you can save space by disabling it in the "View" menu.
