**Legend:** 🐾 Pattern, 💡 Realization, 😺 Meme, 🔭 Tool, 📚 Article/Book

💡 "Leading by Lollipops" - be frequently kind and caring for people around you. You will make a big difference in people's lives. Sometimes without even noticing. - [Drew Dudley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCBrkrFrBE\&t=3s)

💡 Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines, sail away from the safe harbor, catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.” - [Sarah Frances Brown](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/09/29/you-did/)

🐾 When unsure about a decision (small, big), go with love for your fellow humans - Unattributed screenshot on social media

💡 Find out whether you do things because of pressure or intrinsic motivation. In the latter case, applying pressure yourself or taking external pressure seriously increases stress and decreases productivity and happiness. - Alexander Thiel

### Books for a better understanding of the world

📚 [The Open Society and its Enemies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Open\_Society\_and\_Its\_Enemies), while being a rather thick book, is easy and fun to read and an amazing tour-de-force through the history of greaco-western philosophy from a strictly humanist viewpoint.

📚 [Blueprint for a Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint\_for\_Revolution) gives an account of the Serbian revolution against Milosevic and others and makes a compelling case for inclusive, nonviolent tactics that pull pillars of society instead of trying to push them over.

📚 [Why Buddhism is True](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why\_Buddhism\_Is\_True) combines first-hand experience with an up-to-date scientific perspective on Buddhism, meditation and mindfulness.

💡 "The wider the breadth of your wisdom, the narrower the path that you can walk. And the more painful if you're not walking that path." - [Joshua Kahn Russel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-kahn-russell-63177568), inspired by Ursula K. Le Guin
