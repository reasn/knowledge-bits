ðŸ“š [The Art of the Start 2.0](https://guykawasaki.com/books/the-art-of-the-start/) excells at explaining how to build startups. It's condensed, fun to read and comprehensive.

ðŸ“š [Traction](https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer/dp/1591848369) showcases frameworks and tactics to do what most startups fail at: Spend at least as much time on understanding customers and adapting to their needs as on product development.

### Making sense of the world and improving it

ðŸ“š [The Open Society and its Enemies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Society_and_Its_Enemies), while being a rather thick book, is easy and fun to read and an amazing tour-de-force through the history of greaco-western philosophy from a strictly humanist viewpoint.

ðŸ“š [Blueprint for a Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint_for_Revolution) gives an account of the Serbian revolution against Milosevic and others and makes a compelling case for inclusive, nonviolent tactics that pull pillars of society instead of trying to push them over.

ðŸ“š [Why Buddhism is True](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Buddhism_Is_True) combines first-hand experience with an up-to-date scientific perspective on Buddhism, meditation and mindfulness.
